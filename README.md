## Welcome!

Welcome to my Github page! :D

My name is Alex and this is my Github. Its nothing fancy or special, just a place to add my code to show my work I have done. Im primarily skilled in building servers, computers and creating networks but I have wanted to dabble just a little bit in code as well. I myself feel like im a beginer coder, however I have learned a bit and can anaylise and have a good idea as to whats going on inside it.

## Projects!

My primary project is https://zetacloud.cloud

It is a Cloud server that I have created, both the physical server and the Front/Backend Code as well. While I have used guides in how to do some of the functions, most of the code work was my own, with research if I ran into issues or asking my DevOps friends how they might go around fixing it. It is still heavily in beta but much more than what it used to be.

Before my Site was no more than a front page and thats it, however recently it gained lots of moving parts. It has its own SQL Database, sign in/out forms, pass reset forms, and a mail server to send you reset links. The code inside my Github is the most recent code I have uploaded to the live server. I will usually code on the local machine for bug testing before pushing it out to the live server that way as I develop, Im not breaking the live one.
